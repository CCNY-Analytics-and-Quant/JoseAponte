# Final Project Assignment

## Primary Objective:

Use Berry Cox's price momentum factors to select basket of assets for a long-short portfolio. Backtest the algorithm for 5 years to check for performance.

## Background

The use of computers and coding allows finance professionals to identify new alpha factors – 
Alpha factors are ways of quantifying where alpha is being generated by an asset. You will be responsible for using Berry Cox’s list of alpha factors to determine the long/short baskets for your portfolio. But in order to test your code and its asset selections, back-testing must be performed

### Requirements:
1. Choose an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, identify those assets 
2. Retrieve historical data for your chosen ETF 
3. Calculate the price momentum factors for each asset in your ETF 
4. Using the price momentum factors, calculate the monthly z-factor score for each asset 
5. Identify long and short baskets (10 to 15 assets in each) using calculated z-factors 
6. Create a backtest to validate performance of your algorithm based on monthly restructuring over the previous 5 years. 
7. Chart: 
    1. Monthly portfolio return bar chart (pos/neg coloring) vs ETF 
    2. Monthly return for long picks vs short picks vs ETF 
    3. Cumulative portfolio return vs ETF
