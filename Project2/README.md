# Efficient Frontier Project Assignment

## Primary Objective

For this project, it will be selected a basket of seven (7) assets, calculate their indiviual risk/return value, combine these into the efficient frontier, and then plot the results

## Background

The Markowitz Efficient Frontier theory, or Mean-Variance Theory, is a fundamental theory of portfolio management. The mean-variance portfolio theory says that any investor will choose the optimal portfolio from the set of portfolios that:
- Maximize expected return for a given level of risk
- Minimize risk for a given level of expected return

The outcome of risk-return combinations generated by portfolios of risky assets gives the minimun variance for a given return.

The efficient frontier is the set of mean-variance combinations from the minimum-variance frontier where, for a given risk, no other portfolio offers a higher expected return.

Any point beneath efficient frontier is inferior to points above. Moreover, any points along the efficient frontier are, by definition, superior to all other points for that combinend risk-return tradeoff.

## Requierement:

1. Choose seven (7) assets *(Preferably something with significant historical data)*
2. Retrieve daily open or close data on your assets for the previous 2 years
3. Calculate the mean, variance, and correlation matrix for all assets
4. Calculate efficient frontier and optimal weights for porfolio
5. Use `MatPlotLib` or `Seaborn` libraries to graph the results
6. Output the calculated optimal weighting *(Identify portfolio weightning for Optimal Sharpe Ratio)* along with the efficient frontier and correlation matrix chart
